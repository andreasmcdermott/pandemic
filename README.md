## Pandemic

Digital version of the Pandemic Legacy Season 1 board game.

Can't be used without the board game.

The code in this repository was updated to match the latest ruleset as the game progressed. That means the current version in this repository represents the last month of Season 1. The code doesn't support starting a new game without large rewrites.

Uses Firebase as a data store.
